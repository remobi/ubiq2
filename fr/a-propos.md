## A propos de moi

Je suis née à Cham....
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
You may have noticed the recent design trend where the header sticks to the top of the screen as you scroll down the page. This is called a fixed header—the header is styled to use position: fixed to take the header entirely out of the page content and stick it to the top of the user’s browser. If your site has a bunch of different sections that your users need to navigate to, a fixed header can be a good solution to keep them from getting annoyed that they always have to scroll to the top to do something new.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The way to implement a fixed header is to change the positioning of the header to fixed while specifying a z-index for the header. Recall from the beginning of Section 5.8 that the z-index determines whether an element is drawn in front or behind other elements. We’ll want to give our header a large value for z-index, which will force the browser to draw the element above other elements (i.e., closer to the user using our stack-of-paper analogy).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The styles to change the positioning value and set a z-index are shown in Listing 127.
