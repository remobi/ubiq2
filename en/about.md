I was born in Chamonix in the French Alps and grew up in Brussels, Belgium. After I graduated from school and a year in the enchanting city of Dublin, Ireland, I obtained a Bachelor Degree of English at the university of Lille, France.

Meandering trails and an opportunity in a business school had me move to gorgeous Aix-en-Provence, France. I studied Tourism Management, then moved to Lyon, France with my newly acquired Tourism Management degree, to start working in the events management industry.

I arrived in the dynamic and beautiful city of Vancouver, BC, mid 2005. I knew no-one in Canada. I clearly remember my first evening in Vancouver, alone, a backpack on my shoulders, a suitcase by my side, a temporary work permit in hand. The future was entirely open!

My competence in three foreign languages, an ability to work with the public, my experience of mountain towns and a capacity to learn fast made me the right candidate for a job as an Information Counselor at the Banff Information Centre. I knew nothing about Banff but was eager to discover the area.

I worked several jobs in the Tourism Industry in Banff until 2010, when I reconnected with Incentive Travel, became an IGA* accredited Tour Guide, worked as an interpreter for Parks Canada and finally started working Freelance seasonally.

I have since become Canadian and expanded my expertise to Tour Directing and Guiding in both languages in other Parks of the Canadian West, as well as in other cities of Alberta and British Columbia.
