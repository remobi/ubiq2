## Ubiquitours - What's behind the name?

Ubiquity is the property of being present in several places simultaneously.

I have been working as a tour guide for 8 years. On a typical work day, it is not uncommon for me to go back to the same location several times wearing a different uniform each time, a phenomenon that has puzzled or amused clients in the past.

This word also illustrates the ability to swap from a role to another in a brief length of time, switching from guest services to guiding, from airport arrival duties to conference services.

I feel this word perfectly depicts an aspect of my job as a freelance guide contracted by different companies every time.
